# FaceDetector
The face detection project utilizes C++ programming language and the OpenCV library to detect human faces in images or video streams.

It utilizes : 
1. C++ Programming Language: C++ is chosen for its efficiency, performance, and low-level control, which are crucial for real-time applications like face detection.
2. OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library): OpenCV is a widely used open-source library for computer vision tasks. It provides various algorithms and tools necessary for image and video processing, including face detection.
3. Image and Video Input/Output: OpenCV handles input from image files (using functions like cv::imread) and video streams (using cv::VideoCapture).
4. Pre-trained Models: For face detection, OpenCV offers pre-trained Haar Cascade classifiers (haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml) which are trained on large datasets to detect frontal faces accurately
